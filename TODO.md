TODO
----
- track energy usage rate
- formalize message format and protocol
- tests (design is starting to take shape, so it is time)
- show how many Debian package updates are available
- show how many Debian package security-updates are available
- monitor disk usage rate of change and alert if suspiciously fast
- bring back CPU usage monitor
- status bar templating language
- retry/cache for sensors fetching flaky remote resources (such as weather)
- throttling of broken sensors (constantly returns errors)
- alert specification language
    - trigger threshold
    - above/bellow/equal to threshold value
    - priority
    - snooze time (if already alerted, when to re-alert?)
    - text: subject/body
- monitor processes
    - totals (grand and per state)
    - zombies
    - threads
    - CPU hogs
    - memory hogs
    - memory leaks (if some process consistently grows)
    - is select process up?
    - log resource usage of select processes
- monitor arbitrary HTTP endpoint availability
    - is status within expected range?
    - response time
        - is responce time within acceptable range?
- report detailed status upon request (to a terminal)
    - use color to indicate age of data
- monitor logins
    - totals (per time period)
        - failures
        - successes
    - most recent
        - success
        - failure
- monitor battery time remaining
    - monitor accuracy (is percentage change rate on track to meet estimate?)
    - adjust estimate based on observed inaccuracies in past estimates (Kalman?)

DONE
----
- [x] actual METAR parser, to replace the flaky `metar` program
    - Replaced it with a parser of NOAA's XML API (piping `curl | hxpipe | awk`)
